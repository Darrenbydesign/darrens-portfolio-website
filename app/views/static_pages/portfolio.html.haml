          I created a new logo design and stationery set for Empire Fence Co for two major reasons. The first reason,I stumbled upon their website and saw that their logo could use a little refreshment. The second reason is I was looking for a company to practice my skills in branding on without testing on a paying client. 
        %p 
          With my design I completely re-imagined the company logo and utilized the company name to create an icon of a crown with separations in between the crown shape that give the icon the appearance of a fence. Upon making this simple change I believe the company name would stick in the minds of their consumers more with this change in their branding persona. The new look would allow them to give potential customers the expectation that this company is a highly credible business that cares about the quality of their professional look as well the quality of their work.

          The Black Epiphany was a movement created for young adults in the African-American culture in New Orleans. Their goal was to start to start an organization that helps get kids in the lower income neighborhoods to realize their potential in life outside of the drug and violence culture that heavily influences their lives. Thus this group was created to break the chains on the minds of this community. I was tasked with creating the logo design for this group that represented their ideals and the group was very happy with the results.

          The Purls and Knit logo was created for a blogger with a small business selling scarves, mittens, gloves, and anything else a person can think of knitting. In addition to that she also makes homemade lotions and soaps. The logo was created using a typeface that mimics knitting yarn coupled with a fun ampersand that mimics a ball of yarn and knitting needles.

          Flyte is a meeting run by various Flyte crews for youth ranging in ages from 13-35 to minister through various forms of expression and talent. I was tasked with creating a logo for this group that represented the ideas of the ministry. Working with the name Flyte I decided approach the design with something simple given that the name was already creatively spelled. The final design for this was inspired by commercial airline captain pins. Given that the members of the organization are referred to as "Flyte Crew members" it appeared appropriate to use the pilot pin as the final choice for the design.

          The work in the images above were my experiment with book cover designs. Here I have taken two books from Classic literature and re-imagined their symbolism and subtle themes. 
        %p 
          Moby Dick 
          is already famously known for involving a white whale and I determined that although I believe the book is not really about the whale it is the most recognizable symbol of the story. As such, I thought I would take a more playful approach to this book to contrast the serious tone of the book. Most covers involve a whale and Captain Ahab on a small whaling boat, but I decided to emphasize the size of the whale through the entirety of the cover. From end to end I have made the cover as white and the flesh of the whale and strategically placed the whale eyes in a manner that makes the pages of the book appear as teeth.

          Great Expectations 
          cover was designed with the concept of time and how the story goes through a sort of ebb and flow of rags to riches and then back again. Time and its affect on several of the characters is really what I believe is at the heart of this book and I wanted the cover to express that imagery.

          This poster was created for a lecture held on the Oral Roberts University campus. The design focuses on an underlying theme of the lecture that concerned the idea about the Christian world-view. The design uses simple icon imagery that pits a love focused mind versus a more law conscious mind.

          Observations is a piece of work created for a student senior art show. The design focuses on the students and their individual sense of style and observing the reflection of that through their work. The design concept was created to show the audience a very close and personal image of the members involved as if they were being watched through a window.

          Almost Maine,
          is a play about love in various forms.After researching the ideas that were utilized in the past for this play I decided to take a similar approach of using the night sky and a park bench since these are shown often in the play. In my design the stars in the sky make the shape of a heart surrounding a yellow "honey" moon and the bench is facing away from the viewer and pointed toward the sky. The bench is empty, but not quite as it is designed to put the viewer of this design in the place of any of the characters in the play.

          Regeneration was a dance performance held at Oral Roberts University. I was tasked with developing promotional materials for the upcoming performance.The promotion package needed to contain on print and digital media to effectively entice the student body to see the performance. The goal of the arrangement of these images was to represent the dancers in an almost cosmic fashion, as if their essence is being lifted up for their audience to see the glorious light of their performance. This idea of regeneration was meant to reflect on the more internal, spiritual side of the metamorphosis, while still showing the effects on the physical through the movements of the dancer's poses.
