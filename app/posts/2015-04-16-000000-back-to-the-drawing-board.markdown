Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua..... blah blah blah... it seems that is all you see on site mockups these days.

What would happen if we just started to write things actually looked like real world text. Messy, less than perfect line-length text? Would we begin to see how bad our cookie cutter designs have gotten? I have started to see that in my own work. Its appauling and embarassing as a designer. I was ashamed for the first time in a while. However, I gave myself the nice excuse of "well there's just nothing better to use at the moment". I know some of you are reading and thinking about the quirky things like **hipsteripsum** and **baconipsum** but those tools still have a similar problem. while the words used are more closely related to our everyday speech they still don't grasp authentic copy on say an ecommerce site (I hope at least) or say a daily news site.

Enough is enough. I have started trying to find articles that exist in the realworld and just past them into my designs to make for a more authentic look at my use of layout and space. After all they copy is king right? There are things like Invision's Craft tool that are almost a godsend for this issue and even other issues.
