##Hello World

Hello everyone, and welcome to the crazy world of mind. Well, its not exactly my mind...well nevermind. I have just transferred my thouhghts onto this magical thing called...paper,well its not exactly paper either...

Oh? You say that you know what paper is already and you even know what a digital blog is in fact? Ok well, aren't you the smart cookie. Well in any case this is blog about me and my adventures in the ever changing and growing world of design. I'll talk a little bit about what thoughts and philisophies on design are in a bit so don't worry you can troll or agree with me soon enough. Alas, this post has come to swift end. Until next time folks and thanks for visiting.
