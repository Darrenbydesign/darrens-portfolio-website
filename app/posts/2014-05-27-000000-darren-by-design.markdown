Well it took a while ladies and gentlemen but its finally here. I bring you to the fruits of my labor, my design portfolio website. After all of the long nights drawing out concepts and coding those designs I have arrived at what you see before you today.This blog post marks the beginning of my career and adventure in the professional world of Graphic Design. 

Having graduated from University only a year ago. I have spent the last few months developing my skills in different mediums of design. Utilizing my print design skills I have been transferring my practices into not only web design, but also into web development. I've titled this post Darren by design, because throughout this experience I have come to realize something very interesting about my design work; I am designing a piece of myself. As I work to bring ideas to reality I can't help but add myself to my work; and from that revelation I thought to name this blog Darren by Design. In this blog I'll share my discoveries as I carve my own path in this industry.
